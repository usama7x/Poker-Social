          <p>
            Refunds Cancellations will guide you about the terms of refunds
            under special circumstances to the advertisers that use Poker Social
            as a platform for advertising their products or services. We may
            offer them a refund in certain circumstances mentioned in this
            article. Our decisions about refunds are different depending upon
            the different cases and rely on the facts and circumstances of the
            particular issue. All refunds that we make are made at our sole
            discretion and without any admission of liability. We notify you
            about any refunds in the Ads Manager section of your Poker Social ad
            account, In case you donâ€™t get any notification from us, that
            means we're not giving you a refund.
          </p>

          <p>
            The process of refund usually takes one month. In case you have made
            a payment using a credit card, you may expect a refund in lesser
            time. We issue credits to the payment method on the account where
            possible. In case that seems not possible, we may issue ad credits
            against the refunds. If you are among those who pay for their ads
            using Monthly Invoicing, we may issue credit memos to them which can
            be applied against open invoices and can be used in the future to
            buy ad services with us.
          </p>

          <h4>Kinds of Refunds That You May Get</h4>
          <p>
            The decision we take regarding refunds are final and made on a
            case-by-case basis. We base our decisions on the facts and
            circumstances of a particular issue. In case, we decide to give you
            a refund then we will notify you. All refunds that we make are made
            at our sole discretion and without admission of liability. When
            understanding the kinds of refunds, keep in mind that:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ad performance:</strong> In every instance, we can not
            guarantee that your ad will reach its intended target audience or
            achieve the desired outcomes. We are not liable to give you refunds
            for poor ad performance or return on investment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ads services availability: </strong> We don't provide
            refunds mechanically once our services are disruptive or
            unprocurable. The data concerning any disruptions to our ad services
            and related problems that will impact Ads Manager is given in Ads
            Manager. We have a tendency to issue refunds on a case-by-case basis
            considering the impact on the ad delivery over a big amount and at a
            considerable rate because of any unplanned disruption of our ad
            services caused by a system bug (a technical issue)
          </p>

          <p>
            You can get information about disruptions to our ads services on our
            Ads standing page with the problems impacting Ads Manager. We do not
            mechanically provide refunds once ad services are unprocurable or
            noncontinuous. Every case related to refunds is differently handled
            by us and is in no way based on any fundamental approach to handle
            such cases. So, if we believe that the ad delivery has been
            significantly impacted, at a higher rate and over a significant
            period, by an unplanned interruption or discontinuation to our ad
            services caused by a system bug (a technical fault), we may consider
            giving a refund.
          </p>
